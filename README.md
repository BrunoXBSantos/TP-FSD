# TP-FSD

Development of a distributed storage system in memory of key - value pairs, assuming an asynchronous system and taking advantage of logical clocks. The work must be elaborated
using Java (and optionally with Atomix, considering only the classes already used in classes). THE
The system must admit that the set of servers is fixed, known and there are no failures. AN
distribution of keys across servers can also be fixed using a hashing function.
